## [Signature Organic (click for website)](https://signature-organic.netlify.com/)
This website is built for a business in Pakistan, Signature Organic Farms. They wanted a site that would showcase some of the reviews, pictures, and work that they do in the community. It is important that the site be responsive and mobile friendly, as per the target market's internet viewing habits. It is built using Gatsby.JS framework, which relies on React to help create static webpages. 

### Build Status

This application allows for CI through Netlify's connection with my GitHub master branch. As soon as my master is updated on GitHub, so is my site.
